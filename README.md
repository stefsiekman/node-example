# Node Example

Example of a class based tree in python.

The output of the program is random, but it might be the following to give an example.

```
Node(count=10)
    #0: Node(count=4)
        #0: Node(count=2)
            #0: Node(count=1)
            #1: Node(count=1)
                #0: Node(count=1)
        #1: Node(count=2)
            #1: Node(count=1)
                #1: Node(count=1)
    #1: Node(count=2)
        #0: Node(count=1)
            #0: Node(count=1)
```
